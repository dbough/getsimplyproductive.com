<!-- Story Section -->
<section class="story">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <div class="story-content">
    <p>Simply Productive was born from a simple observation: most productivity tools and systems are overcomplicated, overwhelming, and often create more work than they solve.</p>
    
    <p>After years of watching small businesses struggle with complex software, endless workflows, and productivity systems that required a manual to understand, we decided there had to be a better way.</p>
    
    <p>We founded Simply Productive on the principle that the best solutions are often the simplest ones. Every app we build, every consulting engagement we take on, and every piece of content we create is designed with one goal in mind: helping you work smarter, not harder.</p>

  <h2>The Simply Productive Philosophy</h2>
  <div class="philosophy-grid">
    <div class="philosophy-item">
      <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Focus Over Features</h3>
      <p>We'd rather solve one problem perfectly than offer fifty mediocre solutions. Every feature must earn its place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="philosophy-item">
      <h3>âš¡ Speed Over Perfection</h3>
      <p>Better to get 80% of the benefit in 20% of the time than to spend months perfecting a system you'll never use.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="philosophy-item">
      <h3>ðŸ”§ Practical Over Theoretical</h3>
      <p>We test everything with real businesses facing real challenges. If it doesn't work in practice, it doesn't make the cut.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="philosophy-item">
      <h3>ðŸ“ˆ Results Over Process</h3>
      <p>We care about outcomes, not how impressive your workflow looks. Simple processes that deliver results beat complex systems every time.</p>

  <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
  <div class="values-list">
    <div class="value-item">
      <h4>Simplicity First</h4>
      <p>Every solution should be easier to use than the problem it solves. If it requires a tutorial, we've missed the mark.</p>

    <div class="value-item">
      <h4>Small Business Focus</h4>
      <p>We understand the unique challenges of small businesses because we are one. Every solution is built with resource constraints in mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-item">
      <h4>Honest Communication</h4>
      <p>We'll tell you what won't work for your business, even if it means losing a sale. Long-term success beats short-term profit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-item">
      <h4>Continuous Learning</h4>
      <p>Productivity isn't a destinationâ€”it's a journey. We're constantly learning and adapting our approach based on real-world feedback.</p>
